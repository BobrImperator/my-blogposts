Taking a look at the object's `Retainers`

![Retainers](/snapshot/class_group_2.png)

Note:
Over in `Retainers` the relationship is somewhat reversed to the previous examples.
`Retainers` indicate some other objects that hold references to the objects we're currently viewing.

Here we're reading: `controller:index` in Object.

That means our Class is stored under a property `controller:index` of Object.

Side note, Object is a very unfortunate generic name here.
